# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 2025.09.30

- This Privacy Policy describes how Festival Tracker ("the bot") collects, uses, and shares information when you use it. By adding and using this bot in your Discord server, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

- "Personal data" refers to Discord user IDs, channel IDs and server IDs.

1. **Information We Collect**  
   The bot may collect and store the following information:
   - Your Discord user ID and username.
   - Commands sent to the bot, including the server where they are invoked.
   - Server IDs, server names, and channel IDs where the bot is used.
   - Channel IDs subscribed to subscription feeds.
   - In the event of an error, the command, and your user ID may be collected in error logs to help with debugging.

   Discord requires you to be at least 13 years old (and older in other countries or jurisdictions). By using this bot, you agree to Discord's Terms of Service and confirm you meet this requirement. Festival Tracker does not knowingly collect personal information from users under the age requirement in your jurisdiction.

2. **How We Use Your Information**  
   - To provide, maintain, and improve the functionality of the bot.
   - To respond with the requested in-game information, such as track details, leaderboard entries, and more.
   - To monitor for abuse, unauthorized access, or misuse of the bot's services.
   - To log command usage and errors for debugging and development purposes.

   We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access. However, no service is ever 100% secure.

3. **Data Retention**  
   Information is retained only as long as necessary to provide the bot's services. For example, channel subscriptions are stored until they are removed. We do not store personal information for extended periods unless required for security or legal reasons.

4. **Third-Party Services**  
   The bot interacts with third-party APIs to provide its features. This includes:
   - **Discord Developer APIs**: For basic bot functionality within the Discord platform.
   - **Epic Games APIs**: For official game data.
   
   These third-party services have their own privacy policies, and we recommend you review them.

   Festival Tracker does not share your data with third parties except as necessary to interact with Discord and Epic Games APIs in order to provide functionality.

5. **Your Rights**  
   You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data collected by the bot. Contact us to continue with this process. Please note that deleting your subscriptions data will mean you will not receive subscription messages.

6. **Changes to This Policy**  
   We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available at [Festival Tracker | Privacy Policy](https://festivaltracker.org/privacy-policy). 
   
   If you are subscribed to Festival Tracker, you will be notified of changes to this policy. Updates will also be posted in the botâ€™s GitHub repository and will be viewable in the commit history, as well as our social media.

   By continuing to use the bot after updates are posted, you acknowledge that you have been informed of the updated Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the updated policy, you should discontinue use of the bot.

7. **Contact Us**  
   If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to request data deletion, please contact us: fnlookup@gmail.com

8. **Governing Law**  
   This Privacy Policy is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States. By using the bot, you agree that any disputes relating to this policy will be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the United States.
