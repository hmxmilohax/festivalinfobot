# Dependencies

This is currently only targetted to run for Windows as that is the environment it is developed and tested in.

To be able to fetch and generate paths you will need two things:

- [CHOpt](https://github.com/GenericMadScientist/CHOpt) CLI binary (CHOpt.exe) in the bot folder.

    For newer CHOpt versions, Qt6 dlls may be required to be copied as well. These files are present in the .gitignore.

Aditionally, the bot is unable to decrypt Festival MIDIs without the correct key.
